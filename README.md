Description:
For the final project, I created a portfolio for myself, including one detailed project page introducing an interactive installation I created. Other projects shown on the home page hasn’t been built in detail due to time limitation.

Using:
With the navigation bar, the users can access to home, work, about me and contact pages.
Interaction: on the project page, the overall showcase will be an animation triggered by scrolling down. On the about me page, there will be an animation of typing to show the sentences on the top. On the detail page, the use can slide the pictures of my project.

External libraries:
I used webflow API, on which I can build animations.
Bootstrap for slider.
JavaScript for typing animation.

iteration from HW7:
Due to classmates’ feedbacks, I changed the layout for contact me to fit the overall design style. And with the form element, it’s more convenient for users.

Challenge:
My major challenge is responsive design. I test the contents to fit desktop, iPad and phones. And also learning a new Web API webflow in the short time span is hard for me.
